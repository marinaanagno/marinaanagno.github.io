I am a first year PhD student at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/maths/) under the supervision of [Prof. Tim Burness](https://seis.bristol.ac.uk/~tb13602/index.html). My main area of research is group theory. I am particularly interested in problems related to permutation groups, the simple and almost simple groups, and subgroup structure.

I am currently co-organising the [Junior Algebra and Combinatorics Seminar (BJACS)](https://sites.google.com/view/bjacs/home) together with Merlin Haith Rowlatt and [Hongyi Huang](https://hongyihuang328.github.io/index.html). This is a new seminar series aimed at PhD students and postdocs in algebra and combinatorics. Please do not hesitate to get in touch for more information about the seminar.

Before coming to Bristol I completed my undergraduate degree at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/). My masters project was on the O'Nan-Scott theorem and base sizes of primitive permutation groups, supervised by Prof. Colva Roney-Dougal. During my undergraduate I also completed research projects on group theory, combinatorics and semigroup theory under the supervision of Prof. Peter Cameron and Prof. James Mitchell.
