I am a first year PhD student at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/maths/) under the supervision of Prof. Tim Burness. My main area of research is group theory. I am particularly interested in problems related to permutation groups, the simple and almost simple groups, and subgroup structure.

Before coming to Bristol I completed my undergraduate degree at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/). My masters project was on the O'Nan-Scott theorem and base sizes of primitive permutation groups, supervised by Prof. Colva Roney-Dougal.
